At some point, the question came up of how solutions should look like.  The
aim was to keep them similar to standard C++ programs, but some kind of
compromise had to be made.  The C++ files numbered one through five show the
solutions that were considered.  Eventually, #4 was chosen.

Primary reasons:
- Ability to pass command line parameters
- No need for the clunky study::endl business
- Clear separation of exercises
- Complete control of initialisation

Problems with this approach:
- Uses a macro (can be avoided per-lesson if desired)
- Requires build system to work properly
- Requires that the header for the lesson be provided (can be worked around).
