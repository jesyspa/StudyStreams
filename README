A semi-interactive way to learn C++, making use of streams.

In order to start, run:
	scons lib/libstudy.a

After that, choose a lesson, edit the main.cpp file accordingly, and then
compile and link main.cpp, loader.cpp, and lib/libstudy.a .

To build with debug information, run:
	scons lib/libdbgstudy.a

After that, build lesson.cpp and main.cpp files in a lesson and link them
together with lib/libdbgstudy.a .

Makes use of:
